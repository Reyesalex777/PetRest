        <p>
            I designed this website to help memorialize lost pets. 
                Now many of us consider pets to be family, others don't,
                either way there's some words enscribed on a tomb all of us can relate to was found on a random tombstone that read 
                "Dewey, 1898-1910. He was only a cat, but he was human enough to be a great comfort in hours of loneliness and pain."
                now when I lost my beloved dog I didn't expect to feel such greif, like many of us who overcome the pain and sorrows of life,
                I've decided to make something good out of it that would forever memorialize our friends who leave us too soon.
